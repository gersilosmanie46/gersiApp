I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems there's a misunderstanding. The provided code snippet is not present in your message. I can only optimize and explain code that you provide. If you have a specific piece of JavaScript or web development code that you'd like me to optimize and explain, please share it, and I'll be happy to assist you.

For instance, if the code were something like this:
```javascript
function getUserData(userId) {
    let user = null;
    $.ajax({
        url: '/api/users/' + userId,
        type: 'GET',
        async: true,
        success: function (data) {
            user = data;
        },
        error: function (xhr) {
            console.log('Error fetching user data:', xhr);
            return null; // Returning null on error as requested by the developer in their original question
        }
    });

    return user; // This will always be `null` because the AJAX call is asynchronous and doesn't wait for completion before returning `user`.
}
```
I could then provide an optimized version with proper handling of asynchronous operations using promises or async/await syntax along with explanations about why these changes are beneficial.
